# ✨ Zenhanced

**Zenhanced** is a minimalist Firefox CSS customization that transforms the Zen Browser into an even cleaner, more refined experience.

It focuses on **cleaning up the UI**, **enhancing smooth transitions**, and **polishing every interaction** — creating a lightweight, distraction-free browsing environment. Tabs, toolbars, panels, and the start page are all redesigned with subtle animations, glass-like effects, and modern transparency to emphasize calmness and clarity.

The overall aesthetic aims to make Firefox feel closer to a **refined hybrid between Zen Browser and a futuristic, lightweight UI shell** — smooth, minimal, and elegant.
